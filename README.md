### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

**My name is Sebastian**, welcome to my github. I am an Android Developer from Guatemala. I have been working with android for the past 2 years - mostly in Kotlin - developing a few apps including a B2B marketplace app called Waybil, my biggest project to date. I love learning about anything that has to do with technology and also really enjoy writing in python and messing around with machine learning tech stacks. 


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a B2B marketplace android app and a Python crypto trading bot
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Solidity and the theory behind developing smart contracts on blockchain


Feel free to reach out if you have you any cool projects you think I could help with :)
