### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

**My name is Sebastian**, welcome to my github. I am an Android Developer from Guatemala. I have been working with android for the past 2.5 years - mostly in Kotlin - developing a few apps including a B2B marketplace app called Waybil, my biggest project to date. I love learning about anything that has to do with technology and also really enjoy writing in python and messing around with machine learning.

### What I am currently focused on ðŸ¤“

- Working on a social game stats tracking app
- Learning all things Web3!
- Freelancing for android and python projects (most recently a webscraper for the BBDO advertising agency)

### What I am doing on the side ðŸ¦¾ ðŸ¤– 

- Working on a Python crypto trading bot using machine learning
- Learning Solidity and the theory behind developing smart contracts on blockchain
    - My first NFT for completing Buildspace's smart contract course ðŸ˜Ž :
