### Hi there 👋

**My name is Sebastian**, welcome to my github. I am an Android Developer from Guatemala. I have been working with android for the past 2 years - mostly in Kotlin - developing a few apps including a B2B marketplace app called Waybil, my biggest project to date. I love learning about anything that has to do with technology and also really enjoy writing in python and messing around with machine learning.

### What I am currently focused on 🤓

- Continuing to improve upon my Android development skills
- Seeing how my Waybil B2B apps could be improved
- Coming up with ideas for another project/app to build

### What I am doing on the side 🦾 🤖 

- Working on a Python crypto trading bot using machine learning
- Learning Solidity and the theory behind developing smart contracts on blockchain
    - My first NFT for being 1 of the first 200 to finish Buildspace's smart contract course
